Navigation Instructions

You will now be asked to find and navigate to a new target in the environment.
A notification will indicate the new target you must find. 
Explore the environment until you find it.
The target will be invisible for a set amount of time,
after which it will become visible.
If you become confident that you know where the target is,
Press Enter to reveal its location (if it isn't already revealed).

There is no time limit. You must remember and navigate to the
target before you may continue to the next trial/task.
